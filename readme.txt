A. Brief Description
This big data program is to classify the traffic accidents dataset in NewYork.
We use the naivebayes, modified-bayes, and decision-tree classification algorithm to 
analyze the relation between different variables. 

B. Development Environment
PYTHON 2.7.10 

C Instructions
In order to run the program, you just need to put the dataset and the python file you want to run in the same working location, and the run it. 
Example:
1.python bayes.py variable class_label
python bayes.py zip day
2.python bayesreason.py variable class_label
python bayesreason.py type reason
3.python decisiontree.py variable class_label
python decisiontree.py reason area
4.python modifiedbayes.py
